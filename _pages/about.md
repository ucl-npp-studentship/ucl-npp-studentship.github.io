The [UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology) will offer four summer studentships in 2026. These studentships are intended to provide successful applicants with hands-on experience of working in an active research group within the department. In particular, you will gain knowledge and vocational experience that will strengthen your CV when applying for postgraduate study or subsequent employment outside of academia. Placements are funded at £2400 per student, which equates to 162 hours at the [London Living Wage](https://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-real-living-wage). As such, placements can run between 4-6 weeks as arranged between the PI and student. Each student will present a short summary of their work at the end of the summer to their cohort and host labs.

<h2>For Prospective Supervisors</h2>

The studentship is intended to bring high quality undergraduates with valuable transferrable skills into your research group. Supervisors must commit to being available for the full duration of the studentship. Projects must be feasible for students with little or no previous research experience to complete within a 6-week placement. Projects requiring ethical approval must already have this in place at the time of application in order to be eligible for consideration. Experimentation on animals protected by UK/EU legislation should not be carried out by the student. A member of staff with the relevant license should undertake this work.

Please note that we may also have funding to supplement one externally funded summer studentship, in line with UCL's policy of paying the London living wage. Please contact either Stephanie or Dan for further information.
